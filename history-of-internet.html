word "LOGIN" at around nine p.m. on October 29, 1969. The command went through 
interface computers built by Cambridge's BBN Technologies (formerly Bolt, 
Beranek, and Newman) on its way to Kline's counterpart Bill Duvall, at SRI 
International (then known as Stanford Research Institute) in Menlo Park, 
California. The first letters, "LO", came through to the SRI machine before the 
system crashed. The minor setback would be fixed quickly, and the connection was 
fully in place by 10:30 p.m. The very first data had been sent between two nodes 
of the ARPANET, a key precursor to the Internet.</p>
<p>"The ARPANET was built to permit ARPA (U.S. Department of Defense Advanced 
Research Projects Agency)-supported computer researchers to share common 
interests without geographical limits," said Bob Taylor, who helped conceive and 
fund the ARPANET in the mid 1960s as head of computing research at ARPA [1]</p>

		<h2 class="auto-style3">Expansion of ARPANET</h2>
<p>
Computers were added quickly to the ARPANET during the following years, 
and work proceeded on completing a functionally complete Host-to-Host protocol 
and other network software. In December 1970 the Network Working Group (NWG) 
working under S. Crocker finished the initial ARPANET Host-to-Host protocol, 
called the Network Control Protocol (NCP). As the ARPANET sites completed 
implementing NCP during the period 1971-1972, the network users finally could 
begin to develop applications.</p>

		<h2 class="auto-style3">First public demonstration</h2>
<p>In October 1972, Kahn organized a large, very successful demonstration of 
the ARPANET at the International Computer Communication Conference (ICCC). This 
was the first public demonstration of this new network technology to the public. 
It was also in 1972 that the initial “hot” application, electronic mail, was 
introduced. In March Ray Tomlinson at BBN wrote the basic email message send and 
read software, motivated by the need of the ARPANET developers for an easy 
coordination mechanism. In July, Roberts expanded its utility by writing the 
first email utility program to list, selectively read, file, forward, and 
respond to messages. From there email took off as the largest network 
application for over a decade. This was a harbinger of the kind of activity we 
see on the World Wide Web today, namely, the enormous growth of all kinds of 
“people-to-people” traffic. [2]</p>
